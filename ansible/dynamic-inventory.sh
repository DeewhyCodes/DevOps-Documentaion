Ansible inventory is a crucial part of Ansible's architecture. It lists all the systems (hosts) that you will manage with Ansible. 
These systems can be organized into groups and can have variables assigned to them. Ansible can use static inventory files or dynamic 
inventory scripts to gather information about your infrastructure.
